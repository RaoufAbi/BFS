# Breadth-First Search (BFS) in Python

## Overview  
This repository contains two implementations of the **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** algorithm in Python:  
1. **Static BFS** - Uses a predefined graph.  
2. **Dynamic BFS** - Accepts user input to construct the graph dynamically.  

## BFS Algorithm  
**Breadth-First Search (BFS)** is a graph traversal algorithm that explores nodes level by level.  
It is commonly used for:  
- Finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.  
- Solving maze problems.  
- Web crawling.  

## Files  
- **`bfs_static.py`** → BFS implementation on a predefined graph.  
- **`bfs_dynamic.py`** → BFS implementation where the user provides the graph structure.  

## Installation  
Clone the repository:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/RaoufAbi/BFS.git
cd bfs-python
